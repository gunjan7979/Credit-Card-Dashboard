Thrilled to share my latest project: Credit Card Analysis with Power BI. 📶 



𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: To develop a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze Credit Card Transactions and Customer Behaviour effectively.



Steps Performed:

Importing data from csv files to Power Bi Model.

There will be two views in the Dashboard

First : Credit Card Transaction Report : which will provide data around Transactions, Revenue, Interest Earned, Quartely & Weekly, on the basis of Expenditure Type,  Card Category, Chips, Education Level, Customer Job, Income Group of the Customers.

Second : Credit Card Customer Report : similar report as first one just with a split of Gender in all the KPIs. 



Dax Query used in Power Bi:

1. Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(

    sum(credit_card[Revenue]),

    FILTER(

        ALL(credit_card),credit_card[Week_Num1] = max(credit_card[Week_Num1])))

2. Last_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(

    sum(credit_card[Revenue]),

    FILTER(

        ALL(credit_card),credit_card[Week_Num1] = max(credit_card[Week_Num1])-1))

3. WoW_Revenue = DIVIDE((credit_card[Current_week_Revenue]-credit_card[Last_week_Revenue]),credit_card[Last_week_Revenue])

4. Revenue = credit_card[Annual_Fees]+credit_card[Interest_Earned]+credit_card[Total_Trans_Amt]

5. Income_Group = SWITCH(

    TRUE(),

     customer[Income]<35000, "Low",

     customer[Income]>=35000 && customer[Income]<70000, "Med",

     customer[Income]>=70000 , "High",

     "unknown"

)

6. Age_Group = SWITCH(

    TRUE(),

     customer[Customer_Age]<30, "20-30",

     customer[Customer_Age]>=30 && customer[Customer_Age] <40, "30-40",

     customer[Customer_Age]>=40 && customer[Customer_Age] <50, "40-50",

     customer[Customer_Age]>=50 && customer[Customer_Age] <60, "50-60",

     customer[Customer_Age]>=60,"60+",

     "unknown"

)
